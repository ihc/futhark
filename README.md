Futhark
==========

Futhark is a purely functional data-parallel programming language.
Its optimising compiler is able to compile it to typically very
performant GPU code.  The language and compiler is developed as part
of the [HIPERFIT](http://hiperfit.dk) project at
[DIKU](http://diku.dk).  The project is still in its early phases, and
the focus has mostly been on ensuring high runtime-performance, so the
language still lacks certain niceties and features.

For more information, see [the website](http://futhark-lang.org).

Also see the [compiler and language
documentation](http://futhark.readthedocs.io) and the [basis library
documentation](https://futhark-lang.org/docs).

Installation
============

Please see our [installation instructions](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Usage
=====

To compile a Futhark program to sequential C:

    futhark-c prog.fut -o prog

Or maybe OpenCL:

    futhark-opencl prog.fut -o prog

And then run it:

    ./prog < prog.input

To interpret a Futhark program:

    futharki prog.fut < prog.input

Hacking
=======

We try to make use of Github issues for organising our work.  Issues
tagged with
[newbie-friendly](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Anewbie-friendly)
do not require deep knowledge of the code base.

Testing
=======

Run the `futhark-test tests` to check how well we're doing.  Use
`futhark-test -t` if you're in a hurry and only want to check that all
the tests compile.
