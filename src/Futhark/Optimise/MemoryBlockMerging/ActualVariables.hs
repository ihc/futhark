-- | Find the actual variables that need updating when a variable attribute
-- needs updating.  This is different than variable aliasing: Variable aliasing
-- is a theoretical concept, while this module has the practical purpose of
-- finding any extra variables that also need a change when a variable has a
-- change of memory block.
--
-- If and DoLoop statements have special requirements, as do some aliasing
-- expressions.  We don't want to (just) use the obvious statement variable;
-- sometimes updating the memory block of one variable actually means updating
-- the memory block of other variables as well.
