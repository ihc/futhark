-- Find all the variables (both free and bound) that occur in a statement and
-- any nested bodies.  We use this to record which extra variables need to have
-- their memory blocks updated when some variable needs updating.  The result
-- might be an empty set, but in the case of If, DoLoop, and kernels, the result
-- might be nonempty.  We cannot just find all variables in the program and look
-- through them every time we need to, since a memory block can (at least in
-- theory) be present in two different places (which also means by two different
-- variable sets) in a program, so we should limit ourselves to looking in the
-- statement declaring a new current use of the memory.
