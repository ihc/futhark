-- FIXME: The coalescing into y[n/2] causes problems for the loop: In the first
-- iteration it uses a_mem -- which has no special index function -- but in the
-- second iteration, if there is a coalescing, it uses y_mem with an index
-- function created from the `[n/2]` slice.
--
-- The previous way to fix this was to set the initial value of a1 to 'copy a'
-- instead of 'a', and then let both the 'copy a' memory block AND
-- double_buffer_mem be coalesced into y[n/2].  This way, the index function of
-- the existential memory block can be kept the same for all its aliased memory
-- blocks.  However, it would necessitate a copy that should not be necessary.
--
-- A better solution is maybe to extend the DoLoop context merge parameters with
-- index functions, so that each iteration can use different index functions.
-- Currently this case is just disabled.
--
-- Also see ixfun-merge-param.fut.

-- Code below should result in 2 successful coalescing
-- operations in the memory block of `y`. These are:
-- (i) @y[n/2] = a1@
-- (ii) `a1 = implicit-copy(x2)` (already optimised away
-- because the result of the body is a copy, so the compiler
-- actually only needs to do 1 coalescing: (i)).
--
-- Note that the coalescing of `x1` in `x2 = copy x1`
-- should FAIL, because its computation requires `a1`,
-- hence `x1` cannot be coalesced in the memory block
-- of `y`, i.e., getting 2 successful coalescing
-- operations would be incorrect! This last memory reuse
-- can potentially be done by linear-scan register
-- allocation later!
