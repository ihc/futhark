-- Test1 Memory-Block Merging
--
-- FIXME: The coalescing seems to work okay, but it cannot handle that x and b
-- are previously fused into a single map, in which the b body is evaluated
-- *first* (which normally would not matter, but is important in this
-- ExplicitMemory representation).  The compiler rightly stops the `x[2] = b`
-- coalescing from happening, since otherwise the body of x would overwrite the
-- entire result of b.  Even if they are swapped back in the right order, the
-- compiler would not recognize that it is legal.  This is very much an edge
-- case.
--
-- It is easy enough to not let it happen in this specific case: Just comment
-- out the code below to restrict the fusion to see for yourself.

-- output { [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

--           [10, 10, 10, 10, 10],
--           [14, 14, 14, 14, 14],

-- Without allocation hoisting, there is only one coalescing opportunity, i.e.
-- `x[2] = b`.
--
-- The other one, i.e. `y = concat a2 x`, only succeeds if the allocation of `y`
-- is hoisted to before the creation of `x` and `a2`.
