    -- Create an array.  The compiler will try to reuse memory for this array.
    -- It has access to the non-existential memory blocks xs0_mem and ys_mem.
    -- ys_mem is lastly used later, so that cannot be reused.  xs0_mem is
    -- aliased by the existential xs_mem, so conservatively it cannot be used
    -- either, since xs_mem and its aliases can be said to interfere with the
    -- entire loop.  However, since ts1 creates a new array that does not read
    -- from xs_mem, we can instead say that xs_mem has a last use in ys and a
    -- first use in ts1.  This allows the compiler to reuse the aliased xs0_mem
    -- inbetween ys and ts1 (assuming xs0_mem does not have its own direct last
    -- use later on, overriding any inherited last use from the existential
    -- xs_mem).
    let ts0 = map (+ k) ns
    -- Last use of ys_mem and ts0_mem.
