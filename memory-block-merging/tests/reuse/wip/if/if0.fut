-- Depending on which branch you take, 'xs' can be thought of to have different
-- live intervals, kind of.  The important thing is that the 'zs' in the
-- then-branch is allowed to use the memory of 'xs'.  A naive implementation
-- might declare that the live interval of 'xs' ends after 'ys', but that is too
-- conservative to handle this case.
--
-- FIXME: The last use analysis does not consider this issue right now.  To do
-- so, it would need something like conditional last uses: For example, the 'k'
-- statement would include the last use of mem_xs with an attribute "this is
-- only true if you have taken the 'then' branch in the if expression whose
-- result is stored in 'ys'".  Somewhat roundabout, but should work.
